# Small-EEG-Projects  

A collection of introductory EEG analysis projects created for documentation and learning. The goal of this repository is to showcase small but meaningful applications of EEG signal processing, serving as a foundation for more advanced work in the future.  

Currently, the repository includes two beginner-level projects:  

- **Motor Imagery Classification**: Detecting whether a subject is imagining movement of the left or right hand.  
- **Eye Blink Detection**: Identifying blinks from raw EEG signals and distinguishing them from background activity.  

Each project is structured to showcase the preprocessing steps, feature extraction techniques, and classification methods involved in EEG analysis.
